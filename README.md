I created a website for the supermarket. I used all the basic elements that we learned in class and added some new skills.
I added CSS to give some designs and color to the website. I added different fonts and their sizes to make them unique.
Added different websites for the groceries list.
Added a picture of the grocery store to gibe customers a feel of the store.
Made a table with different groceries in the store.
HTML Elements- background color, font, color, href links, image, tables, borders, highlighting borders, rows, columns.
